		<h2>The Hobbit</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Frodo</em> saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, 
			and walked off at a surprising pace; 
			but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent,
			almost as if he was carrying a great weight.
			The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the <strong>twilight</strong>.
			<span>Frodo did not see him again for a long time.</span>
